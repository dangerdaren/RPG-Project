## Coursework Project
This project was part of a course I took on intermediate-to-advanced programming, where we discussed [saving and loading](Assets/Scripts/Saving/SavingSystem.cs), created an RPG [character stat system](Assets/Scripts/Stats/BaseStats.cs) using [scriptable objects to store character progression](Assets/Scripts/Stats/Progression.cs), and made [persistant objects that do not get destroyed between scenes](Assets/Scripts/Core/PersistentObjectSpawner.cs).

While it isn't much of a game, the WebGL link does allow you to play around in the scene to see the things we learned implemented.
